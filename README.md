# 2018: An Anxiety Odyssey

_2018: An Anxiety Odyssey_ Is the brainchild of Ryan Barbour, Bennett Robertson, and Anthony Scola for the class _Digital Arts: An Introduction_ taught by Professor Jean-Fran√ßois Charles at The University of Iowa. Our project's installation was operated in Practice Room 0381 in Voxman's basement.

Our installation was an exploration into anxiety. Our goal was to subtly induce anxiety in our audience. It was designed for at most a few people in a group to experience at any one time. This was achieved via a combination of both audio and visual cues.

When walking into the the room, the door was located at the south east corner. There were semi-perpindicular corners in the room at each cardinally diagonal direction. not clearly 90 degree angles but close enough.

There were four total ultrasonic sensors. Three ultrasonic sensors were placed on the other corners where the door wasnt. One sensor was also placed around a vent on the ceiling in order to assure that people would hit the sensors regardless.

Out of the three sensors that were placed on walls, two required to be taped to band stands so as to follow the code of tape not being allowed on the walls. 
The third wall sensor was taped to some of the sound proofing on the walls since it did not have wood or paint that could be damaged.

A strobe light, along with a computer and audio board most of the installation was connected in the south west corner of the room. 
One of our coats was draped over the computer so light from the screen would not affect the mood of our installation.

A speaker was placed next to the entrance, and audio was emitted to be fairly loud.

In the dark, most of what could be seen was not made immediately aware to the audience. With the strobe light, audience could faintly see where to walk around, and could see where the sensors were located.
The look of the installation did not need to be nice, could even look ugly with wires taped to walls and , so long as the functionality was maintained and it was safe for audience, we maintained the functionality of our 
installation and tried to keep it fairly disconcerting.
